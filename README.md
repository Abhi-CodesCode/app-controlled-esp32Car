# README for App-Controlled Car Using MicroPython, ESP32, and Flutter

## Project Title: App-Controlled Car for Disabled Persons Using MicroPython, ESP32, and Flutter

### Project Description

This project showcases the creation of an app-controlled car designed to assist disabled persons. The car can be operated using voice commands and on-screen buttons via a Flutter-based mobile application. The project utilizes MicroPython on an ESP32 microcontroller and leverages Realtime Firebase for data management.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how technology can aid disabled individuals by providing a means to control their vehicle effortlessly. Additionally, the project incorporates IoT sensors to prevent accidents, ensuring a safer driving experience.

### Features

- **Voice Control**: The car can be controlled using voice commands, making it convenient for users who may have difficulty using traditional control methods.
- **Button Control**: For users who prefer tactile feedback, the car can also be controlled using on-screen buttons within the mobile app.
- **IoT Sensors**: Equipped with IoT sensors to detect obstacles and prevent accidents, enhancing the safety of the vehicle.
- **Realtime Firebase Integration**: Utilizes Firebase for real-time data management and communication between the app and the car, eliminating the need for both to be on the same network.

### Technologies Used

- **MicroPython**: Used for programming the ESP32 microcontroller.
- **ESP32**: A powerful microcontroller used to control the car.
- **Flutter**: A mobile app development framework used to create the control application.
- **Realtime Firebase**: Used for real-time data management and communication between the app and the car.

### Portfolio Showcase

This repository serves as a portfolio to demonstrate the innovative project I created. Due to the complexity and the need for a full hardware setup, it is not intended to be a step-by-step guide for replication. The project involves intricate hardware components and configurations that cannot be easily reproduced from the provided information alone.

### Installation and Setup

While this project is not designed for replication, the following outlines the general setup and tools used:

1. **ESP32 Setup**
   - Installed MicroPython on the ESP32.
   - Uploaded custom MicroPython scripts to the ESP32.

2. **Flutter App Development**
   - Developed the mobile application using Flutter.
   - Implemented voice and button control features.

3. **Firebase Integration**
   - Configured Realtime Firebase for seamless data communication between the mobile app and the car.

### Usage

1. Power on the ESP32 and ensure it is connected to the internet.
2. Open the Flutter app on the mobile device.
3. Use voice commands or on-screen buttons to control the car.
4. Monitor the car's surroundings using the IoT sensors to prevent accidents.
